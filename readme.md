# Programming Foundations: Algorithms

Algorithms are the universal building blocks of programming. They power the software you use every day, whether it's a spreadsheet, a social network, or a driving assistant.

Algorithms offer a way to think about programming challenges in plain English, before they are translated into a specific language like C# or JavaScript.

Some of the most popular and useful alorithms for searching and sorting information, working with techniques like recursion, and understanding common data structures.

Different algorithms have different performance implication, and knowing how to evaluate the performance of a given algorithm.

## Objectives

* Measuring algorithm performance
* Working with data structures such as arrays, stacks and queues
* Looping and recursion
* Sorting data
* Searching data
* Filtering and value counting with hash tables

## Algorithm Characteristics

### Algorithm Complexity

* Space Complexity: How much memory does it require?

* Time Complexity: How much time does it take to complete?

### Inputs and Output

* What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

### CLassification

* Serial/parallel, exact/appropriate, deterministic/non-deterministic

---

## Common Algorithms

### Search Algorithms

* Find specific data in a structure (for example, a substring within a string)


### Sorting Alorithms

* Take a dataset and apply a sort order to it

### Computational Algorithms

* Given one set of data, calculate another (is a given number prime?)

### Collection Algorithms

* Work with a collection of data (count specific items, navigate among data elements, filter out unwanted data, etc.)
